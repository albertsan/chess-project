Chess Game Developed Using SDL and C++
======================================

Two Player(Human vs Human) Chess Game with Interactive Graphical Interface
Players take turns and move their pieces until a king is dead...

This project was part of the course DV1107(Programming and Data Structres) in the second year of bachelors of science
program in Electrical Engineering at Blekinge Institute of Technology.

I want to keep making changes and improve the code and the whole project design. So, I'm here..I also wanted it 
to be available for reference to my work...So I can share easily.

I wanted to practice how linked lists work..So I made my own class as linked list which stores the positions of each
piece and name initials.

To be able to compile and run this project one requries that:
   1) SDL is configured correctly by including all the include files and lib files
   2) SDL image and SDL ttf is configured in a similar way
   
....I'll be making my source code more easy to follow by splitting relevent codes in different source and header files
as time goes by...
